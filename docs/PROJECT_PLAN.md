# Goals & Objectives
- Provide accurate, real-time data
- help users compare grocery prices efficiently.

# Target Users
- Any Australian who wants to save when shopping.

# Challenges & Solutions
- The application will need access to the real-time grocery prices. If one of the websites don't have API available, I will need to use web scraping.

# Problems that I ran into
- command, flutter doctor on VS Code gave me cmdline-tools missing error, I fixed it by opening the Android Studio, SDK manager, SDK tools tab, and ticked on cmdline tools and applied it. When I ran flutter doctor again, the error disappeared.
